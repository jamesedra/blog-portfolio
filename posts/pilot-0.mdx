Welcome to my portfolio (of sorts). I'm currently a second-degree computer science student as I am writing today. I plan to make this site to showcase what I have learned and experiment stuff with it.

### Opening the doors to this idea box

The purpose of this portfolio/blog is twofold. For one, it serves as a display of my knowledge and skills I have acquired on this journey. You'll find projects, experiments, and exercises in software development, as well as a few of my archived works when I was a full time architectural designer.

Secondly, I would like to make this my homebase for exploration. I plan to do expand my knowledge and deploy it here that sometimes might not fit in the current theme of this website. It might not be imaginable now since I did my best to match everything, but I hopefully would keep experimenting with intriguing and unconvential digital crafts in this idea box. This creates a great way to keep updating the website and make it feel fresh after all.

### Navigating through the site

The site currently has three main pages. This is the current Post page, where you will be able to see updates and remarks of my work. The Work Page will be a simple display of my current to past projects if you are interested in seeing how I use my skills. And finally, the Home page which is the mixture of both.

### Upcoming projects

As I am writing right now, I have a lot of time in my hands. Other than updating this website, I would like to study more on the different areas in software development, maybe start with something my previous experience as a designer can be combined with. If you're someone who enjoys developing interesting programs, shoot me an email if you're interested in collaborating or have ideas to share, I will gladly try to help.

#### A few remarks about making the website

This is my very first development in Next.js so it took a bit longer than I would have wished. I would like to thank Kuiliang Zhang, my friend in UBC, for inspiring me to create this blog as my current project. Developing from scratch was a bit of a challenge for me, as I usually just focus on exercising algorithms rather than creating web projects. But after completing this site, I would like to continue working on my skills in web development.
